    "# ABSTRACT : \n",
    "# In this project, you will analyze and segment the customers of an e-commerce company by using the RFM approach. \n",
    "# This will enable the e-commerce company to optimize their retention and acquisition strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Market Outlook: \n",
    "# E-commerce stores which became success stories were successful in targeting the desired customers. \n",
    "# One of the techniques by which they were able to achieve this was customer segmentation i.e. \n",
    "# by segmenting the existing customers based on frequency of purchases, monetary value etc. \n",
    "# E-commerce stores who designed market strategies based on mass marketing soon realized the need of customer segmentation \n",
    "# as an alternative to save cost and efforts in the digital sphere. In a real-world segmentation scenario, \n",
    "# there might be hundreds of variables which can be used but broadly they segment the customers by the following characteristics:"
